## :star2: About the Project

TEMAN is an Android application designed to detect diseases in rice plants, aiming to assist paddy farmers in identifying potential threats to their crops. As a dedicated developer, I have contributed to the success of this project, which achieved funding in the "Pekan Kreativitas Mahasiswa (PKM)" competition in 2021. The positive outcome reflects the effectiveness of the application in aiding farmers by promptly identifying and addressing plant diseases. This accomplishment stands as a testament to my proficiency and commitment in application development.<br>
